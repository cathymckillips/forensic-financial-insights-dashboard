# 💼 Forensic Financial Insights Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard designed to uncover suspicious financial activity through key risk metrics, anomaly detection, and transaction analysis — empowering investigators and analysts with actionable insights.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Forensic Financial Insights Dashboard** helps identify high-risk countries and potential fraudulent financial behavior by analyzing transaction patterns, duplication, and timing anomalies.

This dashboard supports forensic accountants, compliance teams, and financial investigators in monitoring, auditing, and investigating large volumes of financial data.

This project uses a fictional or anonymized dataset of global financial transactions, with fields including:
- Country of origin Risk Levels
- Transaction amount
- Average Risk score
- Percentage of Weekend Transactions
- Total Amount of Suspicious Transactions
- Duplicate flag

Data was preprocessed in Power Query and modeled using DAX to enable advanced insights and interactive filtering.

## 📌 Key Features

- 🌍 **Country Risk Table**  
  A sortable table highlighting countries with unusual or elevated risk levels based on transaction scoring logic.
